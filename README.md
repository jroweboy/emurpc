## EmuRPC - External Scripting Framework for Emulators

### Overview

Emulators often get requests to add a scripting layer to the emulator, but there isn't really any good solution to this problem yet. Adding a embedded language to the emulator means that you are now locked to that language and implementation, limiting platform availability of the emulator, and restricting users to a single language.

EmuRPC makes it simple for emu devs to add a powerful and flexible RPC to their emulator with minimal effort. Just add a few callbacks, and EmuRPC will handle all of the protocol's details.

### License

EmuRPC is under the MIT license, but links with libraries that are not MIT. These are wholly compatible with the MIT so it shouldn't be an issue.
